        <h1>Positioning</h1>
        <p>Positioning is a very important concept in CSS. It is used to set the position of an element. An element can be positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. The position property is used to set the position of an element. The position property can have the following values:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>static</li>
            <li>relative</li>
            <li>absolute</li>
            <li>fixed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The static value is the default value. The relative value is used to set the position of an element relative to its normal position. The absolute value is used to set the position of an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor. The fixed value is used to set the position of an element relative to the viewport.</p>
        <p>The top, bottom, left, and right properties are used to set the position of an element. The top property is used to set the top position of an element. The bottom property is used to set the bottom position of an element. The left property is used to set the left position of an element. The right property is used to set the right position of an element.</p>
        <p>The z-index property is used to set the stack order of an element. The z-index property can have the following values:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>auto</li>
            <li>number</li>
        </ul>
      
        
       
        <p>The auto value is the default value. The number value is used to set the stack order of an element. The higher the number, the higher the stack order of an element.</p>
